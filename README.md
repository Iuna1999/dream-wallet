UX ideas for a bitcoin wallet

The purpose of this project is to share some ideas for a wallet that would include simple contracts like multi-signature and time locks but is aimed at consumer users. Simple enough so my mum can use it (not my grandma though)

Bitcoin is still in phase of collectible/store of value, and not yet in medium of  exchange (no-one spends their coins). So may be this work is for the future but the future is built today. Also, if it’s not bitcoin it will be another coin: the future is crypto.
